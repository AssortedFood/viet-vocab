# TODO

- auth
    - write tests
    - add recaptcha
    - tests for recaptcha
- match user device settings dark || light mode
- adjust VocabCard component to move the edit and delete buttons up and into the ui, instead of on their own row (and maybe shrink them a bit, too)
- currently editing a card does **not** re-run the api calls for accent correction or audio generation, some decision around this feature needs to be made (remove it || support it)
- do we want the description audio to include the english bit? do we even need description audio?
